# Lab 8a - wireframe-exercise

This project is a practice file to mimic a wireframe template that I created with [InVision](https://kameronwatts273064.invisionapp.com/freehand/Untitled-m2L5spavd?dsid_h=854bc68fa509ff810199bd33ea258587dc381b1d10099e91b83e6178b321709a&uid_h=92874519897ed93cb6813f1c093e2c34aea1dec2bf5af741c0341b335e3787c4).

## Future of Project

I will more than likely use this layout to build a real estate or coffee shop website. This is to be determined due to the versatility of such a simple yet clean structure.

This project was primarily coded with HTML and CSS but React components will be implemented for the connected webpages that will soon be constructed.
